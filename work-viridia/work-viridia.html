        <p class="body-text challenge-description">Redesigning an entire app is a highly involved process. Viridia had not previously invested in real design work. Their app lacked a visually pleasing user interface and had several problems that were identified throughout the app and addressed in this redesign.</p>

Each task can be opened for more information and can also be marked as complete.<br><br>The main problems with the Home page’s previous design were aesthetic. In this redesign, tasks open as pop-ups, and can be marked as complete from this pop-up. This creates more continuity within the app. The option to edit the task’s description and frequency directly from the home page was added to simplify the number of steps in this user flow. Plant birthdays were added to allow users to easily track the growth of their plants.</p>

        <p class="body-text explore-body-text">The Explore page  allows users to view Viridia’s entire catalog of plants and search for new plants.<br><br>There were several problems with the previous design’s Explore page. Not all plants were directly accessible via the Explore page. Additionally, there was no way to sort plants, and they did not have adequate information. Adding a plant was overwhelming, and the call to action to add a plant to the user’s garden was buried within the page.<br><br>In this redesign, all plants are showcased directly on the Explore page and can be sorted by collection. More information for each plant was added. Adding a plant now opens as a pop-up and is broken down into easy-to-digest steps.
